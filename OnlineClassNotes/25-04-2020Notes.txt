	              CSS Rules
1. How the priority is given for styles when defined  multiple times for same element?

A. If same attribute are used across multiple times then the last defined set of styles are applied.
    The additional effects, which are not configured in the latest are accessed from the previous.


Ex:
<head>
    <style>
        h2 {
            color:red;
            background-color: yellow;
        }
        h2 {
            color:green;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>CSS Rules</h2>
</body>

O/P:   Heading will use - Green Color for Text and
		       Yellow for Background

2. How effects are inherited? How effects are defined for parent and child elements based on priority?

A. If child element is not provided with effects then it will by default access the parent effects.
    If child element is defined with effects, then the specified effect will apply instead of using parent.


3. How to control Inheritence?
A. Inheritence can be controlled by using CSS values
	a) inherit
	b) initial
	c) unset
	d) revert (new - not supported on every
		browser)
   inherit : It sets the property value applied to a
	selected element to be the same as the
	parent. 

   initial:  It set the property value applied to a selected                 element to be the same as the value set for                    that property.
  
   unset : It set the default value for property.
 
  Note: initial and unset , if not defined then they by default it is inherit [ inherits the body ].

Ex:
<head>
    <style>
      body {
          color:red;
      }
      ul {
          color:blue;
      }
      .style1 {
          color:green;
      }
      .style2 {
          color:initial;
      }
      .style3 {
          color:inheirt;
          background-color: yellow;
      }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li class="style1">CSS</li>
        <li class="style2">JavaScript</li>
        <li class="style3">JQuery</li>
    </ul>
</body>

4. The priority of styles for any element based on selector.
	1st Priority	Id Selector
	2nd Priority	Class selector
	3rd Priority	Type Selector

Ex:
<head>
    <style>
      h2 {
          color:red;
      }
      #headColor {
          color:yellow;
      }
      .heading {
          color:blue;
      }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h2 class="heading" id="headColor">CSS Rules</h2>
</body>

O/p :  Heading is applied with Id effects.

Note: All effects are applied to an element accessed from Id, class and type. If attributes are same then they will be applied according to priority.
